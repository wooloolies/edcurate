// Runtime constants for hooks. Mirrors the convention in `cli/constants/`:
// constants here, types in `types.ts`. The `Vendor` type in `types.ts` is
// derived from `VENDORS` below so the value and the type stay in sync.

/**
 * Host LLM CLIs supported by Oma's hook layer. This is the single source of
 * truth for which vendors hooks (keyword-detector, persistent-mode, hud,
 * skill-injector) recognise. Adding a new vendor here propagates to the
 * `Vendor` type and to runtime guards such as `CLI_INVOCATION_AT_START`
 * in `keyword-detector.ts`.
 *
 * Excludes:
 *   - `oma` itself (the project's own CLI, listed separately where needed)
 *   - `copilot` and `hermes` (skill-install targets, not hook runtimes)
 *   - third-party harnesses (omc, omx, omo, ouroboros)
 *
 * MUST mirror `cli/types/vendors.ts` VENDORS. Hooks run as standalone
 * scripts in user environments and cannot import from cli/, so the value
 * is duplicated here intentionally. Keep the two arrays in sync by adding
 * or removing the same vendor in both files; CI does not enforce this.
